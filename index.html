            <p>wakia, my beautiful gorgeous handsome man. its been a long time since ive felt this earnestly about another. so deeply and undoubtedly in love and understood. you are the greatest gift to me, single handedly picked out from the noise. 
                I knew how special you were from the moment our eyes met, and you looked beyond - into my soul and touched it. I have been obsessed with you since I learned your name, and my breathe hitched everytime i snuck glances at you just to see you looking back at me.. youre kind, sweet, observant, caring and hilarious, also ragebait tf outta me😒, but i wouldnt change any of that for the world. 
                i love loving you myles, im eternally grateful i get to be with someone as amazing as you. i love you so much, and theres so much waiting for you in the years to come.
